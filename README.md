# frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map
Neighborhood Map Project for Udacity Nanodegree program


## How to run the project

You can run it by opening the index.html file on the project folder or setting up a simple server to run on the same folder and run localhost in your browser. One way of doing this is with Python 3 (you should have python pre installed) with the command python -m http.server [<portNo>].

When you open the main page, the application will automatically start and  the tests will also start to run. The test results will display at the bottom of the page after all the page components are loaded.
